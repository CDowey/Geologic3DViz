Building upon plotting boreholes and features derived from geophysical logging using the plotly library ([see repository](https://github.com/CDowey/BoreholeViz)), the notebooks in this repository include plotting raster data and geospatial datasets.

### Features
* Raster surfaces
* Line features derived from shapefile or other spatial files
* Boreholes
* Planar surfaces
